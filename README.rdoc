= has_barcode

A nice wrapper for Barcode generation using {barby}[https://github.com/toretore/barby].

  class Product
    include HasBarcode

    has_barcode :barcode,
      :outputter => :png,
      :type => :code_39,
      :value => Proc.new { |p| p.number }

    def number
      self.id
    end
  end

  Product.new.barcode       # => Barby::Code39 object
  Product.new.barcode_data  # => <Barby::Code39 object>.to_png

== Why has_barcode is a good choice for Heroku
Other libraries – such as {barcode_generator}[https://github.com/anujluthra/barcode-generator] – commonly rely on {gbarcode}[https://github.com/ahx/gbarcode], a GNU Barcode C library. This is problem since you need to install GNU barcode which {Heroku does not support}[https://github.com/perezd/barcoder/issues/1]. Luckily <tt>has_barcode</tt> doesn't have this dependency.

A typical Heroku setup might look like:

  class Coupon < ActiveRecord::Base
    include HasBarcode

    has_barcode :barcode,
      :outputter => :svg,
      :type => :code_39,
      :value => Proc.new { |c| c.id }

  end

Notice we're using the <tt>svg</tt> outputter. This is good choice since it doesn't need to store images in the file system, which can be an issue given {Heroku's read only file system}[http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/read-only-filesystem].

To display your barcode in the view, do something like:

  @coupon.barcode_data.html_safe


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
